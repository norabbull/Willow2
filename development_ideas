    Make it custaomizable of how many group levels one wantes to calculate for.
    Optimize calculation for one group level only, and rather run program
    multiple times for each group level that is to be calculated. 
    
    
    Restructure calcPopDists. 
    Make it work for one gorup only and make another function to do the process
    the number of group levels it should be calculated for. 
    
    Reason to calculate both in one go is to save time - values only have to be
    retrived once from the matrix and so the matrix only have to be
    looped once instead of twice. 
    
    Idea: Time how long it takes to loop a matrix. 
    Make a measure. 
    Maybe you can even include this in your matrix to show the program and 
    development idea. 
    
    
Name changes: 
    
    "pop" and "group" is to be changed to "subtype" or "st"
    
    Everything refering to a gene should get a general name instead. 
    
Variable/ constant changes: 

    Remove self.pop_info (substituted by subtype_info)
    Remove super_pops and sub_pops, substituted by subtype_names
    
    
    
SDR of trees with zero distances in the matrix should obtain value NaN or 1.
There is perfect clustering, however, on may want to exclude these from the 
results. Trees with SDR = 1 is unknown if had zero- distmat vaules or if 
S was calculated so in another manner. 
I think they should get vaule = 1.
