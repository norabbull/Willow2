
How to run a program: 

All programs are run through exexcution of treeRun.py.
The function to run is specified in the yaml configuration file.
The path to this config file is given as the only argument upon execution. 
The execution happens through running the shell script "run_[func].sh".

It is therefore, upon every exectution, important to check the following: 
 1. All paths in the main_config_[func].yml config file are correct.
 2. The correct main_config_[func].yml file is given in the shell script.

Folder structure for each job should be consistent, following the template structure. 
Additional parameters in the main_config_[func].yml file may occur for particular functions.

If job is disrupted, it can be started again by sending the list of unprocessed files as 
input_files argument in main config file. 
No job-files of aldready ran jobs should be edited upon new run. If file needs editing for the new job, 
a copy must be made. Names of files involved in 2nd, 3rd ... started jobs are named thereafter.
