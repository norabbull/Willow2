# Method

## Overview

Willow version 1.0 software, implemented in Python 3.7, was run to calculate GDR values and GDR null distributions is described in details. 

Full code scripts are attached in the bottom of this section.

R was used for a few procedures. 

This section includes: 

- Listed program and package versions

- Input file descriptions
  1. Configuration file
  2. Group information file
  3. Distance matrix files
  
- How to run Willow1.0
  1. GDR calculation 
  2. Random GDR value calculation

- Willow1.0 source code:
  - treeInformation.py
  - treeMetrics.py
  - treeRun.py
  - TreeMain.py

## 1. Configuration file

The configuration file (`main_config.yml`) is structured in yaml-format and contains all optional input parameters to Willow. The configuration file is the only input-argument given to run a Willow job. 

`main_config.yaml` template with comments:

```
---
 func: *specify function*
 input_group_info: *path to group information file*
 input_dist_folder: *path to folder containing distance matrix files*
 output_folder: *output folder path where all output files are sent*
 output_values: *filename to store output values (CSV format)*
 output_unprocessed: *file to store unprocessed file information (CSV format)*
 categories: *group categories*
 num_random_values: *number of random values*
 filter_skip: *path to file containing list of genes to skip*
 filter_select:  *path to file containing list of genes to skip*
 
```
#### Additional parameter details: 

- Valid options for `func`: 
 1. `calcGDR`:calculate GDR value*
 2. `calcGDRnull`: calculate random GDR value*
 
- `input_group_info` contain information to specify groups. An arbitrarily number of categories/group levels can be specified, but all samples must belong to a group for each category. 

- `input_dist_folder`: all distance matrix files to process are contained in this folder in CSV format. See details below.

- `group categories` must be written on format: `category1___category2__..."`, i.e. using three underscores as delimiter. Category names must be equally specified in the distance matrices row- and column names.


- `filter_skip` and `filter_select` only works for lists of gene names.
These parameters can be used to provide a list of genes that should not be processed or selected for, respectivly, to make a selection of files from the folder with input files specified by `input_dist_folder`.

## 2. Input distance matrix

The distance matrix(ces) to calculate GDR for are stored in a common folder, where all files in folder are processed in one job-run. 

An example of a 3x3 distance matrix file: 
```
,AFR___LWK___NA19308,AFR___LWK___NA19317,EUR___GBR___HG00096
AFR___LWK___NA19308,0.0,0.00236,0.00236
AFR___LWK___NA1931,0.00236,0.00236,0.00118
EUR___GBR___HG00096,0.00236,0.00118,0.00354

```

All row- and column names refer to a sample/leaf node stemming from the phylogenetic tree and must be formatted as a string that includes group information for all specified group categories. The group names, given by a 3-letter acronym, are separated by three underscores, "___". The order of specified groups in the string determines which group category the gorup is specified for. This information corresponds to how group information is given in the `Ã¬nput_group_info`-file.    



# Calculation of GDRs with Willow 1.0

[General description]
Willow version 1.0 was used to calculate GDR values for an arbitrarily number of distance matrices representing phylogenetic trees. The distance matrices can be generated as described under
