How to run a program: 

Execution of Willow: 

- All programs are run through exexcution of treeRun.py.
- main_config.yaml configuration file specifies all custom pathways reuired for the calculation. 
- The path to this config file is given as the only argument upon execution. 
- The execution happens through running the shell script.


It is therefore, upon every exectution, important to check the following: 
 1. All paths in the yaml config file are correct.
 2. The correct yaml file is given in the shell script.
